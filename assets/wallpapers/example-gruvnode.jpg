GRUVNODE WALLPAPER PLACEHOLDER
==============================

This repository keeps this file text-only on purpose so PR tooling that rejects
binary assets can still create patches.

Replace this file with your preferred wallpaper image and keep the same path:
assets/wallpapers/example-gruvnode.jpg

The installer copies it to:
~/.local/share/wallpapers/gruvnode.jpg
