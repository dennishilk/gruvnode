# gruvnode
Gruvnode is a **minimal Debian 13 setup for the ThinkPad T480**, built around **XMonad (X11)** and optimized for **low resource usage, Intel iGPU performance, and long sessions**.  This repository also serves as a **documented personal system backup** — a reference of how the system is configured, installed and maintained.
